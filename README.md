 # How to play (optional if you know how to play osu!):

Left-Click = Note click / Select level

More accuracy = More health

Keep your health above zero. If you don't, You will lose!

Play fast and normally combined. This can really improve your clicks and accuracy.

It is recommended to play with a pen to avoid "mouse drift". commonly casued by dirt and debris locked inside the mouse. You can still play with a mouse if you want to.
