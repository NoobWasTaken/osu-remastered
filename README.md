 # How to play (optional if you know how to play osu!):

Left-Click = Note click

Keep your health above zero. If you don't, You will lose!

Play fast and normaly combined. This can really improve your clicks and accuracy.

It is recommended to play with a pen to avoid "mouse drift". commonly casued by dirt and debris locked inside the mouse. You can stil play with a mouse if you want to.
